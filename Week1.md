### DATA VISUALIZATION PIONEERS
#### Florence Nightingale
Florence Nightingale, aka the "Lady with the Lamp", best known for her nursing work during the Crimean war. She was a nurse and a statistician who collected and analysed data on the deaths of soldiers in Crimean war. The data showed that more soldiers were dying from infectious diseases due to unsanitary conditions and poor ventilation than from wounds of war and other causes. Florence Nightingale instituted reforms to mitigate these outcomes. She created visualizations to communicate her findings and the results of her interventions to the general public.
