## Course Description
This course will use the open source [The COVID-19 Impact Project](https://covid19impactproject.com/) as a basis to explore ways to humanize the unfolding data on the coronavirus pandemic. Students are invited to collaborate on the COVID-19 Impact Project. Students will discover how data flows from public github repositories and tools needed to visualize the data. We will review other data-centric open source projects related to COVID-19 and discuss the questions they are trying to answer or problems they are trying to solve. We will examine historical and contemporary data visualizations. Using data visualization as a scaffold, we will explore ways to support community driven mourning and memorialization. Students can choose to participate as javascript coders, p5js explorers, UI/UX designers, citizen journalists, or data science explorers.

## Course Structure
Students will participate in lectures, research, discussion groups, hands on design and build
activities and group or individual projects. Students will be expected to dedicate at least 3 hours of work on weekly assignments in between sessions.

**[Week 1:](Week1.md)** Lecture, discussion groups. Assignment 1 : Select course project and work on the first iteration to present in the next class.

**[Week 2:](Week2.md)**  Students present the first iteration of the course project for in-class discussion and feedback. Assignment 2 : Revise and build on course project based on feedback

**[Week 3:](Week3.md)** Students present the second iteration of the class project. All assignments must include documentation.
