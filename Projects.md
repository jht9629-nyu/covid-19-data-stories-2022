# COVID-19 IMPACT PROJECT
Thank you for your interest in the COVID-19 Impact Project https://covid19impactproject.com/  The goal of this project is to design a crowdsourced platform for the general public to contribute ideas, share personal stories, memorialize loved ones, and examine statistics relative to our collective COVID-19 experience.  

The project has several components and there are many ways that students can get involved.

#### **Memorial Ticker Installation in Jay Street windows**  [Click here to sign up]

1. Ideate and implement a community facing and community engaging installation in the "Garage" window area. Installation will be centered around the COVID-19 Memorial Ticker currently on the ITP floor. This is a medium term project with weekly meetings.

Community Voices: This is an interdisciplinary project that requires journalistic talent in addition to all the wonderful multidisciplinary talents of ITP students. 
Develop and flush out ideas for a project that centers and amplifies the voices and pandemic stories of NYU essential workers.  Lots of ideas here including a "garage" installation. Some inspiration for this project I gathered from the "Penn Listening Lab" at Penn State University Hospital and storycorps.  We can envision and build out online and installation versions. Will involve data visualizations and extracting stories from data.
Pandemic Color Line: This will tie in with John Henry's installations and explorations of W. E. B. Du Bois' statement on 'The Color Line' for NYU Black and Latin X community members. 
Same as above for the surrounding community.
Covid Orphanhood in New York City
This is a big project and my baby.  The vision is to set up a non profit that attends to all of the cascading traumas of covid orphanhood and collects and uses data on NYC "covid orphans" to provide support for the unacknowledged and unmitigated traumas of the pandemic on children who have lost primary caregivers during this time.  Goal is to get NYC Mayor and City Council to fund along with other philanthropic foundations and individuals. Envision working with pediatricians at NYU hospital and medical school. This project involves research, writing, data visualization and data storytelling.
